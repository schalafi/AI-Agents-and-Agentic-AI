    "# GenAI MVP Lab: Planning as a Data Scientist\n",
    "In this lab, you'll use Generative AI as a co-creator to plan a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a data-driven app. Instead of working alone, you'll collaborate with GenAI to brainstorm features, prioritize tasks, and map out a build plan.\n",
    "You will do just like Priya, an ML engineer at a healthcare startup, who used GenAI to scope and refine her MVP for extracting insights from clinical trial PDFs."
